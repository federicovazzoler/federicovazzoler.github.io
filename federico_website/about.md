I’m Federico, a former physicist and data scientist with a deep passion for problem-solving and innovation. My expertise lies in data modeling, statistical analysis, and machine learning, which I have and I'm constantly appling across diverse fields such as particle physics, renewable energy, and financial modeling.

I thrive in interdisciplinary environments, translating complex data into actionable insights and impactful solutions. Whether optimizing solar energy forecasting systems or analyzing vast datasets to uncover trends, I am motivated by challenges that drive sustainability, efficiency, and precision.

With a solid foundation in both academia and industry, I am actively seeking opportunities to contribute to cutting-edge projects, either in the environmental sector or as a quantitative analyst in finance.

Let’s build solutions that matter!
